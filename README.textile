This script generates score icons for the API.

Install Processing 2.0.1 from http://processing.org, load amee_score_icon_generator.pde and run.

It produces a score_images/ folder with 3 subfolders, one for each size, style1/, style2/ and style3/. Each of these has icons for the 100 scores, plus the N/A icon. Upload them to S3.
